            As a passionate researcher and PhD student at Clemson University, I am committed to advancing healthcare education and literacy through AI technologies. My research focuses on improving user engagement with healthcare chatbots by using Bayesian statistical models to better understand human-AI interaction. My goal is to make healthcare information more accessible and equitable.
